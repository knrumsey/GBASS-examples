# GBASS_Examples_2023

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains code showing how to run the examples found in the manuscript *Generalized Bayesian MARS: Tools for Emulating Stochastic Computer Models* (link to paper when published). 

  - **mcycle:** Script for quantile regression using the well-know motorcycle dataset. 
  - **Piston:** Scripts for performing simulation study comparison of GBASS package with several competitors on the stochatic Piston function.
  - **Fish:** Scripts for quantile regression comparison on the LogoNet "Fish capture recapture" agent based model.
  - **Epi:** Scripts for quantile-based sensitivity analysis of a stochastic SIR model with intervention. 
  - **qrsvm** A local copy of the qrsvm package which is (at the time of writing) inaccesible on CRAN. 


To run these examples, the `GBASS` package ([found here](https://github.com/knrumsey/GBASS)) is needed. The `GBASS` package can be installed by typing:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/GBASS")
```
